The Monty project is a comprehensive implementation of Stacks and Queues, fundamental data structures in computer science. Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while Queues adhere to the First In, First Out (FIFO) paradigm. This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly environment for working with these data structures, facilitating seamless integration into various software applications.
